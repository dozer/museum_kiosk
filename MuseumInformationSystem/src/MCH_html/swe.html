<p>When the first digital <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a> appeared in the early 1940s,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine. Practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the "stored program architecture" or <a href="/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture" title="Von Neumann architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>. Thus the division between "hardware" and "software" began with <a href="/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)" title="Abstraction (computer science)">abstraction</a> being used to deal with the complexity of computing.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Programming_languages" title="Programming languages" class="mw-redirect">Programming languages</a> started to appear in the 1950s and this was also another major step in abstraction. Major languages such as <a href="/wiki/Fortran" title="Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a href="/wiki/ALGOL" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a>, and <a href="/wiki/COBOL" title="COBOL">COBOL</a> were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific, algorithmic, and business problems respectively. <a href="/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra" title="Edsger Dijkstra" class="mw-redirect">E.W. Dijkstra</a> wrote his seminal paper, "Go To Statement Considered Harmful",<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> in 1968 and <a href="/wiki/David_Parnas" title="David Parnas">David Parnas</a> introduced the key concept of <a href="/wiki/Modularity" title="Modularity">modularity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Information_hiding" title="Information hiding">information hiding</a> in 1972<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> to help programmers deal with the ever increasing complexity of <a href="/wiki/Software_systems" title="Software systems" class="mw-redirect">software systems</a>. A software system for managing the hardware called an <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a> was also introduced, most notably by <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a> in 1969. In 1967, the <a href="/wiki/Simula" title="Simula">Simula</a> language introduced the <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a> paradigm.</p>
<p>These advances in <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a> were met with more advances in <a href="/wiki/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">computer hardware</a>. In the mid-1970s, the <a href="/wiki/Microcomputer" title="Microcomputer">microcomputer</a> was introduced, making it economical for hobbyists to obtain a <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> and write <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a> for it. This in turn led to the now famous <a href="/wiki/Personal_Computer" title="Personal Computer" class="mw-redirect">Personal Computer</a> (PC). The <a href="/wiki/Software_Development_Process" title="Software Development Process" class="mw-redirect">Software Development Life Cycle</a> or SDLC was also starting to appear as a consensus for centralized construction of software in the mid-1980s. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the introduction of several new Simula-inspired object-oriented programming languages, including <a href="/wiki/Smalltalk" title="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Objective-C" title="Objective-C">Objective-C</a>, and <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B" title="C++">C++</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Open-source" title="Open-source" class="mw-redirect">Open-source</a> software started to appear in the early 90s in the form of <a href="/wiki/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a> and other software introducing the "bazaar" or decentralized style of constructing software.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Then the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> and the popularization of the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> hit in the mid 90s, changing the engineering of software once again. <a href="/wiki/Distributed_systems" title="Distributed systems" class="mw-redirect">Distributed systems</a> gained sway as a way to design systems, and the <a href="/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a> programming language was introduced with its own <a href="/wiki/Virtual_machine" title="Virtual machine">virtual machine</a> as another step in <a href="/wiki/Abstraction" title="Abstraction">abstraction</a>. <a href="/wiki/Programmers" title="Programmers" class="mw-redirect">Programmers</a> collaborated and wrote the <a href="/wiki/Agile_Manifesto" title="Agile Manifesto" class="mw-redirect">Agile Manifesto</a>, which favored more lightweight processes to create cheaper and timelier software.</p>
<p>The current definition of <i>software engineering</i> is still being debated by practitioners today as they struggle to come up with ways to produce software that is "cheaper, better, faster"<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In Canada, there is a legal requirement to have P.Eng when one wants to use the title "engineer" or practice "software engineering". In the USA, beginning in 2013, the path for licensure of software engineers will become a reality. As with the other engineering disciplines, the requirements consist of earning an ABET accredited bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering (or any non-ABET degree and NCEES credentials evaluation), passing the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam, having at least four years of demonstrably relevant experience, and passing the Software Engineering PE Exam. In some states, such as Florida, Texas, Washington, and other, software developers cannot use the title "Professional Engineer" unless they are licensed professional engineers who have passed the PE Exam and possess a valid licence to practice.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Specializations include: in industry (<a href="/wiki/Requirements_analysis" title="Requirements analysis">analysts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Software_architecture" title="Software architecture">architects</a>, <a href="/wiki/Software_developer" title="Software developer">developers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Software_testing" title="Software testing">testers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Technical_support" title="Technical support">technical support</a>, <a href="/wiki/Middleware_analyst" title="Middleware analyst">middleware analysts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Project_management" title="Project management">managers</a>) and in academia (<a href="/wiki/Educator" title="Educator" class="mw-redirect">educators</a>, <a href="/wiki/Researcher" title="Researcher">researchers</a>).</p>
<p>Most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008. Injuries in these occupations are rare. However, like other workers who spend long periods in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in CS, not SE. Given the difficult certification path for holders of non-SE degrees, most never bother to pursue the license.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Impact_of_globalization">Impact of globalization</span></h3>
<p>The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the <a href="/wiki/Developed_world" title="Developed world" class="mw-redirect">developed world</a> avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of <a href="/wiki/Offshore_outsourcing" title="Offshore outsourcing">offshore outsourcing</a> (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Worker_Visa" title="Foreign Worker Visa">foreign visa workers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, <a href="/wiki/Computer_programming" title="Computer programming">computer programming</a> does appear to have been affected.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the <a href="/wiki/Follow-the-sun" title="Follow-the-sun">follow-the-sun</a> workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> When North Americans are leaving work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans are arriving to work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.</p>
<p>While global outsourcing has several advantages, global - and generally distributed - development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers. This includes but is not limited to language, communication, cultural or corporate barriers. Handling global development successfully is subject to active research of the software engineering community.</p>
